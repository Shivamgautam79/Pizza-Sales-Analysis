# Pizza-Sales-Analysis


**Project Title: Pizza Sales Analytics**

Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analytics project! In this project, we've gone through a thorough process to transform raw pizza sales data into valuable insights for your business. Here's a breakdown of what we've accomplished:

1. **Data Cleaning:** We started by carefully cleaning the messy raw data, ensuring that it's accurate and reliable. This step is crucial to prevent any errors in our analysis.

2. **Data Verification:** We meticulously verified the data through a rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. This ensures that the data is not only clean but also consistent and ready for analysis.

3. **SQL Queries:** We harnessed the power of SQL queries to double-check data integrity. By querying the data, we confirmed that it meets our quality standards and is ready for deeper examination.

4. **Data Analysis:** Our data analysis provides valuable insights. We've identified the top-performing sellers, shining a spotlight on the stars of your business. Conversely, we've pinpointed the underperforming ones, allowing for focused improvement efforts.

5. **Data Trends:** Through data analysis, we've uncovered sales performance trends. This information is vital for making informed business decisions and planning for the future.

6. **Data Visualization:** We've created an easy-to-understand PowerBI dashboard. This visual representation of the data allows you to see key insights at a glance, making it simple to track your business's performance.

7. **Days and Times:** Our analysis also reveals which days experience the highest sales and the most lucrative times of day. This information is a goldmine for optimizing your business operations.

8. **Data Modeling:** To make all of this possible, we've built robust data models. These models structure the data for efficient analysis and visualization.

In summary, this project encompasses data cleaning, data mining, data extraction, data visualization, data modeling, and in-depth data analysis. These efforts culminate in a user-friendly PowerBI dashboard, providing invaluable insights into your business operations. With these insights, you can make data-driven decisions to boost your business's performance.
